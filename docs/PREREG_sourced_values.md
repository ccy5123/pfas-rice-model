# Pre-registration: no value without a source

Committed before any replacement run. The user's rule (2026-10-25): the tool may contain no
value chosen without a source. The inventory is `params/value_provenance.csv`; this file fixes
how each row is resolved and how the results will be judged, so the runs cannot steer either.

## 1. How a value becomes admissible (user's choice: staged)

1. **Literature.** A value read in a source (DOI or URL, page/table, verbatim quote), rice first,
   then other cereals with the species stated. A reported range is kept as a range.
2. **Fit**, only when the data identify it: the 95 % bootstrap interval of the fitted value
   (refit over resampled cells) is narrower than the physically possible range, and the fitted
   configuration is then scored on data not used to fit it.
3. **Simplify.** If neither, the mechanism (or the bound) that needs the value is removed, or
   reduced to the form the data do identify (e.g. a saturable carrier with unknown Km, Vmax
   becomes a linear entry when the dose response is linear over the data).
4. **Range.** If a value is still needed, the model runs at both ends of its physically
   possible range and reports the outputs as an interval.

Numerical values (floors, tolerances, grids, segment counts) are admissible only if the results
**converge**: moving the value toward its limit changes no reported number by 0.0005 or more in
log10 (half the last digit of a 3-decimal log10 score). A value whose results keep moving as it
approaches its limit is structural and must be fixed in the model (`validation/numerics_convergence.py`).

## 2. How a comparison is decided (user's choice: statistical)

Fixed margins (0.10, 0.3, 0.05/0.10, 1.5x, 90 %) are retired. A comparison of configuration B
against A on one endpoint uses `validation/decision_stats.decide`: paired bootstrap over the
scored items, 95 % percentile interval of RMSE(B) - RMSE(A); "better" if the interval is below 0,
"worse" if above, "tie" otherwise; the resample count doubles until the verdict and the interval
ends (3 decimals) are stable.

- A **default change** needs "better" on the endpoint it targets and "not worse" on every other
  scored endpoint (Yamazaki observable and the transfer endpoints).
- Datasets that chose the default (Tang, Kim, Li) keep their selection caveat; a dataset that
  was used to fit a value is never used to score it.

## 3. Order of work

1. Literature values in (composition, phloem, shoot shares, carrier, site management, soil).
2. Structural corrections that need no new number: each organ's own K_cw in the redistributed
   shoot; the inverse's measurement sigma = the default's transfer error
   (`APRIORI_LOG10_RMSE`) instead of 0.15; per-hill tables need the planting density as input.
3. Convergence fixes (the grain gate; see §4).
4. Re-fit the transport and lipid parameters on the new inputs, without the L_Ph upper bound
   (it binds for seven congeners and has no source).
5. Re-run every scored endpoint and the past decisions under §2; record the outcome below.

## 4. Expectations (written before the runs; misses will be recorded)

- E1 The gate's young-panicle peak does not converge as the organ-mass floor goes to 0
  (it grew 1.41x -> 9.65x over floors 1e-3 -> 1e-5 kg), while harvest values move less.
- E2 The BDF tolerances, the harvest sub-daily grid and the inner 1e-9 floor converge.
- E3 No rice Michaelis-Menten Km/Vmax for PFAS exists in the literature; the carrier becomes a
  linear entry.
- E4 Without the L_Ph upper bound, the long-chain L_Ph fits rise above 1.
- E5 Re-sourced organ composition moves the Yamazaki scores by less than the transfer-band
  width (log10 0.49), because the lipid and transport fits re-absorb it.
- E6 At least one shoot lever (retention, stem_transp_frac, lam_grain) has neither a source nor
  an identifiable fit and ends as a range output.
